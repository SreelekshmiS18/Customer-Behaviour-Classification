# Customer-Behaviour-Classification
This repository features a project aimed at predicting customer purchasing behavior using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about 400 clients, including their demographics and purchase decisions.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to determine whether a customer will purchase a specific product based on various attributes such as:
- **User ID**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Estimated Salary**
- **Purchase Decision** (indicating whether the customer made a purchase)

### Key Components

- **Data Analysis**: The project begins with an exploration of the dataset to understand customer demographics and identify patterns in purchasing behavior.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Various models are implemented, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVC)
  
Each model is evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting customer purchases.

### Deployment

The trained model is integrated into a user-friendly application using the Tkinter library, allowing for real-time predictions based on user input.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to install the necessary libraries and download the dataset. The project includes detailed instructions for setup and execution.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an excellent resource for understanding customer behavior through data analysis and machine learning. It provides insights into how demographic factors influence purchasing decisions and demonstrates practical applications of machine learning models. Contributions are welcome!
